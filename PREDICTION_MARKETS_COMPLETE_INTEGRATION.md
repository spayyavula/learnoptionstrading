## 💾 Data Structures

### **Key Interfaces**

```typescript
// From kalshiService.ts
interface PredictionMarket {
  ticker: string
  title: string
  category: string
  yes_price: number
  no_price: number
  yes_bid: number
  yes_ask: number
  no_bid: number
  no_ask: number
  volume: number
  open_interest: number
  end_date: string
  status: 'active' | 'closed' | 'settled' | 'expired'
}

interface PredictionMarketPosition {
  id: string
  market_ticker: string
  position_side: 'yes' | 'no'
  quantity: number
  average_price: number
  market_price?: number
  unrealized_pnl?: number
}

interface PredictionMarketOrder {
  market_ticker: string
  order_type: 'market' | 'limit'
  side: 'yes' | 'no'
  action: 'buy' | 'sell'
  quantity: number
  limit_price?: number
  time_in_force: 'gtc' | 'ioc' | 'fok'
}
```

### **Portfolio Stats Calculation**

```typescript
const totalPnL = positions.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.unrealized_pnl || 0), 0)
const totalValue = account?.portfolio_value || 0
const winningPositions = positions.filter(p => (p.unrealized_pnl || 0) > 0).length
const winRate = positions.length > 0 ? (winningPositions / positions.length) * 100 : 0
```

### **Gamification Logic**

```typescript
// XP and level based on activity
const tradesCount = orders.length
const newXP = 2340 + (tradesCount * 25) // 25 XP per trade
const level = Math.floor(newXP / 1000) + 1 // Level up every 1000 XP

// Achievements unlock based on conditions
achievements = [
  { title: 'First Trade', unlocked: orders.length > 0 },
  { title: 'Portfolio Builder', unlocked: positions.length >= 5 },
  { title: 'Profit Maker', unlocked: totalPnL >= 100 }
]
```

## 📊 Mock Data Generation

Since Kalshi API may have limited demo data, the application generates mock data for enhanced features:

### **News Articles**
- Generated from market titles
- Random sentiment assignment
- Time-based published_at (staggered by hour)
- Mock price changes and impact levels
- Affected markets linked to positions

### **Gamification**
- XP calculated from order count
- Achievements unlock based on actual activity
- Challenges track daily trades
- Streak increments with daily activity (would need database persistence)

### **Social Features**
- Mock top traders (would need backend)
- Mock comments and discussions (would need backend)
- Copy trading placeholders (would need execution logic)
