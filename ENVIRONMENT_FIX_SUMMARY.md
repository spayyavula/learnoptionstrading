# Environment Variable Loading - Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was not properly reading the .env file, causing environment variables to not load correctly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added explicit `root: process.cwd()` to ensure correct working directory
- Added `envDir: process.cwd()` to specify where to look for .env files
- This ensures Vite looks in the correct location for environment files

### 2. Created Environment Validation System
**New File:** `src/utils/envValidator.ts`
- Validates all required environment variables on startup
- Checks format and validity of critical variables
- Provides detailed diagnostics and error messages
- Masks sensitive values in logs for security

### 3. Added Visual Debug Component
**New File:** `src/components/EnvDebug.tsx`
- Interactive environment diagnostic tool
- Shows loaded variables and their status
- Displays validation errors and missing variables
- Available in bottom-right corner (development only)
- Click "üîç Check Environment" to see diagnostics

### 4. Enhanced Startup Logging (`src/main.tsx`)
- Added comprehensive environment validation on application start
- Shows clear error messages if environment variables are missing
- Provides helpful hints for fixing configuration issues
- Runs diagnostic checks automatically

### 5. Created Environment Template
**New File:** `.env.example`
- Comprehensive template with all available environment variables
- Categorized by required vs optional
- Includes helpful comments and descriptions
- Safe to commit to version control

### 6. Updated Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- Added context-specific build commands
- Improved environment variable handling
- Added proper build optimization flags
- Separated development, preview, and production builds

### 7. Created Troubleshooting Guide
**New File:** `ENV_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Step-by-step troubleshooting for common issues
- Clear explanations of how environment variables work
- Solutions for development and production problems
- Quick reference checklist

## How to Use

### For Development

1. **Check your .env file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .env
   ```

2. **Compare with template:**
   ```bash
   diff .env .env.example
   ```

3. **Restart dev server after changes:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check browser console for validation results:**
   - Look for "üîç Environment Diagnostics" section
   - Verify all required variables show ‚úÖ
   - Click "üîç Check Environment" button if needed

### For Production (Netlify)

1. **Add environment variables in Netlify UI:**
   - Site Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add all `VITE_` prefixed variables
   - Do NOT include .env file in git

2. **Trigger new deploy:**
   - Variables are injected at build time
   - Check deploy logs for validation errors

## What Changed

### Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added explicit envDir configuration
- `src/main.tsx` - Added startup validation
- `src/App.tsx` - Added EnvDebug component
- `netlify.toml` - Improved build configuration

### Files Created
- `src/utils/envValidator.ts` - Validation utility
- `src/components/EnvDebug.tsx` - Debug component
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- `ENV_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - User guide
- `ENVIRONMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing

Build completed successfully:
```
‚úì 2600 modules transformed
‚úì built in 23.40s
```

All environment variables are now:
- ‚úÖ Explicitly configured in Vite
- ‚úÖ Validated on startup
- ‚úÖ Visible in debug tools
- ‚úÖ Documented in template
- ‚úÖ Protected in .gitignore

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server** to apply all changes
2. **Check the browser console** for validation results
3. **Click the debug button** to verify environment loading
4. **Review ENV_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** if you encounter issues
5. **Compare your .env with .env.example** to ensure all required variables are set

## Important Notes

- All environment variables MUST be prefixed with `VITE_`
- The .env file MUST be in the project root (not in src/)
- You MUST restart the dev server after changing .env
- Variables are injected at build time, not runtime
- Never commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)

## Verification Checklist

After restarting the dev server:
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_URL: Set"
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Set"
- [ ] No "‚ùå Missing required variable" errors
- [ ] EnvDebug button appears in bottom-right
- [ ] Application features work correctly
- [ ] Build completes without errors

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Read `ENV_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Use the EnvDebug component to see exactly what's loaded
4. Verify .env file location and format
5. Ensure no typos in variable names
