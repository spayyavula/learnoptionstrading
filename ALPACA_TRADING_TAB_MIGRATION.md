- Natural discovery path for users wanting to trade

### Visual Placement

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### `src/components/EnhancedTrading.tsx`

**Added:**
```typescript

import AlpacaCredentialsAccordion from './AlpacaCredentialsAccordion'
import AlpacaSetupWizard from './AlpacaSetupWizard'

// State
const [showAlpacaWizard, setShowAlpacaWizard] = useState(false)

// UI Section (after disclaimer)
<div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm p-6 border border-gray-200 mb-6">
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
      Live Trading with Alpaca
    </h2>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
      Connect your Alpaca account to execute real trades.
      Practice with paper trading first, then seamlessly
      switch to live trading.
    </p>
  </div>
  <AlpacaCredentialsAccordion
    onSetupComplete={() => {
      console.log('Alpaca setup completed from Trading page')
    }}
    onLaunchWizard={() => setShowAlpacaWizard(true)}
  />
</div>

// Wizard Modal (at end)
{showAlpacaWizard && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50
       flex items-center justify-center z-50 p-4 overflow-y-auto">
    <AlpacaSetupWizard
      onComplete={() => {
        setShowAlpacaWizard(false)
        alert('Alpaca account connected successfully!')
      }}
      onCancel={() => setShowAlpacaWizard(false)}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

#### `src/pages/Settings.tsx`

**Removed:**
- AlpacaSetupWizard import
- AlpacaCredentialsAccordion import
- showAlpacaWizard state
- Entire "Live Trading Integration" card section
- Wizard modal at bottom

## Three Setup Formats Still Available

All three interactive formats remain fully functional:

- **Best for:** Quick setup, experienced users
- **Features:** Real-time validation, help icons, test connection

### 2. Step-by-Step Wizard
- **Trigger:** Click "Use Setup Wizard" in accordion
- **Best for:** First-time users, comprehensive guidance
- **Steps:** Environment → Credentials → Verify → Disclosures

### 3. Direct Integration
- **Location:** Can be accessed from either format
- **Features:** All security, encryption, compliance
