```typescript
{
  id: 'my_strategy',
  name: 'My Strategy',
  description: 'Strategy description',
  type: 'bullish', // or 'bearish', 'neutral', 'volatility'
  complexity: 'intermediate', // or 'beginner', 'advanced'
  legs: [
    {
      action: 'buy',
      optionType: 'call',
      strike: 0, // Will be auto-calculated
      expiration: '30d',
      quantity: 1
    }
  ],
  maxRisk: 100,
  maxProfit: 500,
  breakeven: [105],
  bestMarketConditions: ['Bull trending', 'Low volatility'],
  worstMarketConditions: ['Bear trending', 'High volatility'],
  timeDecay: 'negative',
  volatilityImpact: 'positive',
  instructions: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],
  examples: ['Example scenario']
}
```

**Customizing Payoff Diagram**:
Edit `PayoffChart` function in `SensibullStrategyBuilder.tsx`:

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. Greeks display is placeholder (values show 0.00)
2. P&L Table shows $0.00 (needs calculation implementation)
3. Strategy Chart tab is placeholder
4. "Add to Drafts" button not yet connected to Supabase
5. Manual P&L entry not implemented
6. Funds & Margins show "--" (needs broker integration)

### Planned Enhancements:
1. Integrate GreeksCalculator for real-time Greeks display
2. Implement P&L table with accurate calculations
3. Add historical strategy performance charts
4. Connect "Add to Drafts" to Supabase strategy_templates table
5. Add strategy saving and loading from user's saved strategies

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Select each underlying asset
   - Load every strategy template
   - Modify strikes with +/- buttons
   - Add/remove legs
   - Change multipliers
   - Place test orders

2. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify payoff diagram renders correctly for all strategies
   - Check color coding (green/red for buy/sell)

   - Test responsive layout on mobile/tablet

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strategies with 3+ legs (Iron Condor, Butterfly)
   - Extreme strike prices (far OTM/ITM)
   - Very short/long expirations
   - High multipliers (10x)
   - Missing contract data

## Performance Notes

- Payoff calculations are fast (100 data points)
- SVG rendering is efficient and scalable
- Template filtering is instantaneous
- No API calls during strategy building (uses mock data)
- Real-time updates without lag

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels needed (future enhancement)
- Keyboard navigation support needed (future enhancement)
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Screen reader support needs improvement
